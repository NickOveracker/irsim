| A 4-bit counter, from Magic's tutorial 11 (tut11a): reset it, then count.
| The web app runs this file when the example loads (Project > Simulation setup).
| The cell's ground is labelled GND, and IRSIM's own is Gnd, so drive it low.
l GND
| The tutorial's clocks, vectors and watched nodes.
@ tut11a.cmd
